				<h1>Ad hoc Projects</h1> 
				<p>Apart from our regular projects, there are certain projects, which we take up on circumstantial basis. Some occasions merit certain service that we take pride in performing. There is only one criterion that we base such impromptu projects- the good of all.<br></br>
                These projects are done on their level of urgency. And as and when the occasion blesses us with an opportunity to serve the society. For these kinds of projects, we accept advice/suggestion of any and everyone, volunteers or not. We debate on the viability of carrying out these projects, contact our volunteers on an urgent basis, discuss the execution, and lo! The project gets a green light and we serve.

                                                <p></p>So, the February of 2015 saw the coming of Mr. Arvind Kejriwal as Delhi’s 7th Chief Minister, having abandoned his seat last year. Before the elections, we had taken a casual survey and found out that a substantial amount of people were reluctant to vote. So, a day before the polls and on the polling day, i.e. 7th February, our volunteers got out of home, voted for their favourite candidate and took to the streets.
                                                <p></p>
                                                They held up banners all around Delhi NCR, on cross-roads, malls (in Noida and Faridabad) and shopping complexes to inspire people to vote. Our smiles knew no bounds when we saw people smiling at us, giving us the thumbs-up and lauding our efforts along with going to vote.<p></p>
                                                We took pride in knowing that we had a hand in seeing a record percentage of voters showing up at polling booths and voting for what they believed was an appropriate candidate for the legislature of Delhi. The rest is history.

                                       At Noon on the 25th of April 2015, tragedy struck the South East Asian region of the world in the form of a massive earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale. The disaster had its epicentre in the Gorkha District of Nepal, and affected regions bordering Nepal and Bihar. It also triggered an avalanche on the Everest and was deemed the deadliest day on the mountain in history.
<br></br>
Sarvahitey, seeing such devastation, was not going to sit idle when our neighbours and own countrymen were suffering adversely. Sarvahitey set out its volunteers to research on how to help those in need. On much asking around and pondering, we found out that there were certain organisations who were directly donating and helping, physically, monetarily and in kind. One of these was the Bangla Sahib Gurudwara Committee.
<br></br>
The next step that we took towards the building of a fallen nation and a fallen state was to ask for donations. It was a major source of encouragement that in a very short duration we collected in the range of Rs. 1,50,000/- in only 5 months of our incubation. We got donations in the form of money, in the form of material and even medical equipment and pharmaceutical products.
<br></br>
Then we approached the Nepal Embassy to get an overview and the specifics of what all was actually required by the government of Nepal and the resurrection forces. The required dry grains, food, medicines and temporary building material. We procured all, through direct donations and through the monetary donations we had received. This project is, by far, our biggest ad-hoc project, yet.

                                                <p>In the month of August, 2016, Assam was ravaged by one of the worst floods which the state has faced in recent past. The mighty Brahmaputra along with its fourteen tributaries derailed the entire State. More than 30 lakh people were affected in 28 districts and almost 7 lakh people lived in relief camps. The numbers amply express the magnitude of disaster and the urgency of help and support required at the time in Assam.
<br></br>
Sarvahitey, in its all-round service, planned to do its bit in this calamity. Members of our NGO talked to people working on ground there and kept in regular touch with government officials who were in charge of providing relief materials to the people. After proper consultation and deliberation
<br></br>
Sarvahitey decided to send mosquito nets, Odomos, sanitary pads, and tents as relief material to Assam. Several members of Sarvahitey, most of them from Assam, left for the affected areas in Assam on the 10 th of August, without concern for their comfortable lives in the metropolitan.
<br></br>
Through this relief drive, a total of 300 Kgs of Rice, 50 Ltrs of Oil, 50 Kg Dal, 50 Tents which could house 250 people, Mosquito Nets, Mosquito Repellants, ORS (4 per person), and 200 T- Shirts were distributed in Assam to a total of 300 people.
<br></br>
Gahpur was one of the worst affected areas in Assam, and the relief that had been provided in that area was not sufficient for the people. So our members along with their friends went from Nagaon to Gahpur through a combination of Road, Boat and on Foot. 
<br></br>
We also had help from the District Collector, Additional District Collector and other members of the administration of the district. Among all of the volunteering camps, ours was the largest. We thank each and every person associated with this project for this huge support. This is what keeps Sarvahitey going.

We at Sarvahitey not only believe in this, but we take it upon ourselves, that each of our endeavour should be such that these words find their true meaning; that our efforts should be such that no fellow human being remains cloth-less or hungry or suffering.
<br>
Gradually, step by step, we have been initiating and pursuing various projects through which we, those who have, are able to reach out to more and more people, those who don't. We are continuously trying to bridge the gap between those who have been fortunate and those who have been less fortunate.
<br>
In this mission, after conducting many successful clothes donation drives, teaching the underprivileged and doing relief work, all of which we shall keep continuing, our next endeavour was conducting food drives.
<br>
To feed the hungry and to quench the thirst of thirsty are considered the greatest charity living beings can do. I that pursuit, a Food Donation Drive was held at Sector 18, Noida.

Mr. Narendra Modi announced the demonetization of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes on 8th November, 2016. Post the declaration issued, there was a rush for legal tender and people flocked to the ATMs and Banks in abundance.<br>
The members of Sarvahitey participated in this fight against corruption and black money.<br>
We did our bit by being present out there with our fellow Indians, the honest tax-paying citizens, going to the bank, to help them, to serve them. We devised a project, Together We Stand, wherein we planned to distribute tea and snacks (Biscuits and Matthis etc…) to the people standing in lines. 
So, mobilizing our volunteers, we distributed the aforementioned at various locations throughout Delhi and Noida. The volunteers were remunerated by the praises and blessings. We will surely stand against anything that stands in the way of the success of our country, and for people to believe in the possibilities.
