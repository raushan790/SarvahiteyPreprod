                                                <!--<h3>What is the legal nature of Sarvahitey?</h3>-->
                                                <p>Sarvahitey was formed keeping in view the fact that a majority of Indian population is devoid of basic needs, and basic infrastructure to self-realize those needs. Being a group of socially conscientious members, Sarvahitey was formed to cater to the underprivileged, their needs, and gradually making them self-sufficient to fulfil their personal, familial, financial and societal obligations.
Through the years, Sarvahitey, as an organisation, has made ample efforts, and executed numerous projects to enhance the conditions of the underprivileged, with the following vision in mind:
 
<h3>1.Social Awareness and Empathy</h3>
Sarvahitey believes that there is a natural tendency in everyone to love. And this love goes unaccounted for, when though there is empathy in people towards people of a lower financial standing, they are hardly able to employ themselves towards bridging that gap. Therefore, Sarvahitey, as its prime vision, has taken upon itself to raise social awareness among people, and utilize the empathy to bring out a social activist in each household. When everyone does some good, the nation becomes better, multi-fold. Sarvahitey plans to imbibe in each, a sense of being socially responsible. Social Service, therefore, should be made a culture among everyone;
<p></p>
<h3>2.Self Sufficiency in Each Individual</h3>
Everyone is capable. No one is born without the ability to nurture and care for himself or herself. But such capabilities of a person remain a distant dream when individuals are not provided the right infrastructure and facilities to become better beings. Sarvahitey, therefore, keeping in mind the foremost requirement for self-sufficiency, i.e. education, (academic, vocational, social, inspirational and otherwise) holds a vision to bring to each one such education that though in the short run, would be only partially beneficial, but will work wonders for the country in the long run; and
<p></p>
<h3>3.The Fountain Effect</h3>
Sarvahitey has an immense belief in the ability of the rural and labour class to transform the entire structure and function of the country. Due to the fact that 2/3rds of the population of the country is dependent upon agriculture, and therefore, rural progress, Sarvahitey has obliged itself to raise the standards of the Indian rural/agricultural economy, to bring it under the purview of globalized development. Sarvahitey has tremendous faith in the ‘Trickle-Up’ or ‘Fountain Effect’, wherein the progress of the entire country will be reflected in the progress of the villages of the country.
 <p></p>
And, in pursuit of the vision, the Members, Volunteers and Affiliates of Sarvahitey have been, are, and will be working ceaselessly. The realization of a sorrow-less and grief-less society will see the culmination of Sarvahitey, i.e. the Good of All.</p>

                                    <p>There are 5 Trustees, who are entrusted with the decision making process of the Trust, i.e. Sarvahitey: <b>Keshav Datta, Prem Prakash, Sanskriti Srivastava, Ankit Malhotra and Smriti Mehrotra</b>. The Author of the Trust is <b>Bharat Datta</b>. Click on the "Team" tab to know more about them.

                                     Apart from them, there are numerous other members, which we may refer to as ‘volunteers’. <b>Volunteers are the life-blood of Sarvahitey</b>; their enthusiasm and commitment forever keeps this NGO a vibrant one. Click on the "Volunteer" tab to know more about them.
                                    <br><br>
                                     Mostly, the Trustees are responsible for planning, researching for, and managing the execution of all the events. However, the philosophy of Sarvahitey is such, that no person is deemed to be higher than the other in the organisation. Everyone shares the same pedestal; only the level of commitment and participation justifies the position of a person in this organisation. Everyone's views/suggestions are taken into consideration; even the decision making process is not insulated from any person exhibiting interest in the functioning of this Trust. Sarvahitey organises public meetings/discussions on regular basis, inviting any advices/suggestions/constructive criticisms that one may have to offer.
                                    <br><br>
                                     Sarvahitey receives continuous support from other organizations as well. Most of the volunteers are students or alumni of <b>Amity Law School, Delhi (GGSIP University). Financial support is provided by some of the employees of Evalueserve (Pvt. Ltd.); AMLPL (Pvt. Ltd.); Qustn (Pvt. Ltd.); Applied Mobile Labs Pvt. Ltd.; Thomson Reuters and CPA Global Inc</b>

                                        <h3>How, When and Where did Sarvahitey come into existence?</h3>
                                      <p>Sarvahitey came into existence by virtue of a very simple realisation, earned after a long history of separate initiatives taken up by the present Trustees. This realisation was that, social work must be an important part of everyone's life, and that it is very easy to do. Forming an NGO is just a constructive outlet, through which anyone and everyone can fulfil his inherent call of working for the less fortunate.</p>

										 <p>Though being associated with different organizations, or involved in various projects, social work was not streamlined in their daily lives, and they all felt a need for that.</p>
                                         <p>One should not cave-in, if a beggar begs for money; that, everyone knew. But, what indeed shall be done for their upliftment, nobody had a clear answer. The Trustees, with the help from the Author, and support from the volunteers, came together and found this organisation.The simple realisation was reached: indeed, social work must be an important part of everyone's life, and it is not hard to do so</P>

                                         <h3>What is the working model of Sarvahitey?</h3>
                                         <p>Sarvahitey has a very simple working model, which is conducive to the busiest of persons. Throughout the weekdays, the Core Members of Sarvahitey plan a particular event, and on a weekend, they execute it. The Core Members invite suggestions in the planning process, from any person interested in doing so. On the appointed date of execution, which is made public with comfortable prior notice, everyone is invited to spare a few hours, and take part in the festival of social work. Any person may come on the appointed date and time, and participate actively in the particular event.
                                         <br> 
										  The Core Members of Sarvahitey take on the responsibility of the entire planning process, engaging with the governmental authorities if need be, and so forth. On the actual occasion, everyone is invited to drink from the nectar of 'sharing and caring'. Since the event takes place on weekends, any student or working professional has the opportunity to take part in various drives.</p>

                                      <p>Sarvahitey doesn't believe in any comparative analysis, nor does it believe in boasting of any superiority. The message of Sarvahitey is simple: anyone can, and must work for the Society, be it by any means. Sarvahitey is just one of the many agencies through which one can give back to the community. Hundreds of people have realised that their call to work for social welfare can be achieved by this organisation, and thousands of blessings have reached them. Though as said earlier, </p>
                                      			<h4>Sarvahitey is just one of those agencies, and it is important to know some of the positive qualities of Sarvahitey:</h4>

The hierarchy of individuals in this organisation is not defined by the post or position that they hold, but their level of participation. Even the decision making process is not insulated from anyone.</li>

                                                    	<i class="fa fa-angle-right text-primary"></i>2. <b>Transparency:</b> Sarvahitey keeps a total transparency regarding its activities and affairs. Anyone can make any queries and seek any clarifications regarding any action of its members, or the organisation as such.</li>

All of its members are independent from any external agencies. This organisation is not run by any foundation, company, firm, institution or governmental agency. Sarvahitey doesn't promote interests of any particular entity, and has no bias or prejudice against anyone.</li>

It is one of the very few organisations wherein money is given secondary importance; the primary concern is towards participation.
