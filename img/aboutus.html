It has its own life, name, stamp and authority. It can grant and seek loans in its own name; it can sue and be sued in its own name. Currently, the legal registration of Sarvahitey is in process, and Sarvahitey is in regular correspondence with the legal authorities. The registration certificate of Sarvahitey is expected to be received in a couple of months.</p>

                                        <h3>Who are the members of Sarvahitey?</h3>
                                    <p>There are 5 Trustees, who are entrusted with the decision making process of the Trust, i.e. Sarvahitey: <b>Keshav Datta, Prem Prakash, Sanskriti Srivastava, Ankit Malhotra and Smriti Mehrotra</b>. The Author of the Trust is <b>Bharat Datta</b>. Click on the "Team" tab to know more about them.
                                    <br><br>
                                     Apart from them, there are numerous other members, which we may refer to as ‘volunteers’. <b>Volunteers are the life-blood of Sarvahitey</b>; their enthusiasm and commitment forever keeps this NGO a vibrant one. Click on the "Volunteer" tab to know more about them.
                                    <br><br>
                                     Mostly, the Trustees are responsible for planning, researching for, and managing the execution of all the events. However, the philosophy of Sarvahitey is such, that no person is deemed to be higher than the other in the organisation. Everyone shares the same pedestal; only the level of commitment and participation justifies the position of a person in this organisation. Everyone's views/suggestions are taken into consideration; even the decision making process is not insulated from any person exhibiting interest in the functioning of this Trust. Sarvahitey organises public meetings/discussions on regular basis, inviting any advices/suggestions/constructive criticisms that one may have to offer.
                                    <br><br>
                                     Sarvahitey receives continuous support from other organizations as well. Most of the volunteers are students or alumni of <b>Amity Law School, Delhi (GGSIP University). Financial support is provided by some of the employees of Evalueserve (Pvt. Ltd.); AMLPL (Pvt. Ltd.); Qustn (Pvt. Ltd.); Applied Mobile Labs Pvt. Ltd.; Thomson Reuters and CPA Global Inc</b>

                                        <h3>How, When and Where did Sarvahitey come into existence?</h3>
                                      <p>Sarvahitey came into existence by virtue of a very simple realisation, earned after a long history of separate initiatives taken up by the present Trustees. This realisation was that, social work must be an important part of everyone's life, and that it is very easy to do. Forming an NGO is just a constructive outlet, through which anyone and everyone can fulfil his inherent call of working for the less fortunate.</p>
                                      			<h4>The present trustees used to work with separate institutions on ad-hoc basis, or on ad-hoc projects, so as to lend a helping hand in the upliftment of the society: </h4>

										 <p>Though being associated with different organizations, or involved in various projects, social work was not streamlined in their daily lives, and they all felt a need for that.</p>
                                         <p>One should not cave-in, if a beggar begs for money; that, everyone knew. But, what indeed shall be done for their upliftment, nobody had a clear answer. The Trustees, with the help from the Author, and support from the volunteers, came together and found this organisation.The simple realisation was reached: indeed, social work must be an important part of everyone's life, and it is not hard to do so</P>

                                      <p>However, the area of operation of an organisation is not defined by its offices, but by its projects. Sarvahitey's projects are mostly based in the National Capital Region, i.e. Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, Gurgaon, and Ghaziabad; though Sarvahitey has run projects in Panipat and Nepal as well.</p>

                                         <h3>What is the working model of Sarvahitey?</h3>
                                         <p>Sarvahitey has a very simple working model, which is conducive to the busiest of persons. Throughout the weekdays, the Core Members of Sarvahitey plan a particular event, and on a weekend, they execute it. The Core Members invite suggestions in the planning process, from any person interested in doing so. On the appointed date of execution, which is made public with comfortable prior notice, everyone is invited to spare a few hours, and take part in the festival of social work. Any person may come on the appointed date and time, and participate actively in the particular event.
                                         <br> 
										  The Core Members of Sarvahitey take on the responsibility of the entire planning process, engaging with the governmental authorities if need be, and so forth. On the actual occasion, everyone is invited to drink from the nectar of 'sharing and caring'. Since the event takes place on weekends, any student or working professional has the opportunity to take part in various drives.</p>

                                      <p>Sarvahitey doesn't believe in any comparative analysis, nor does it believe in boasting of any superiority. The message of Sarvahitey is simple: anyone can, and must work for the Society, be it by any means. Sarvahitey is just one of the many agencies through which one can give back to the community. Hundreds of people have realised that their call to work for social welfare can be achieved by this organisation, and thousands of blessings have reached them. Though as said earlier, </p>
                                      			<h4>Sarvahitey is just one of those agencies, and it is important to know some of the positive qualities of Sarvahitey:</h4>

The hierarchy of individuals in this organisation is not defined by the post or position that they hold, but their level of participation. Even the decision making process is not insulated from anyone.</li>

                                                    	<i class="fa fa-angle-right text-primary"></i>2. <b>Transparency:</b> Sarvahitey keeps a total transparency regarding its activities and affairs. Anyone can make any queries and seek any clarifications regarding any action of its members, or the organisation as such.</li>

All of its members are independent from any external agencies. This organisation is not run by any foundation, company, firm, institution or governmental agency. Sarvahitey doesn't promote interests of any particular entity, and has no bias or prejudice against anyone.</li>

It is one of the very few organisations wherein money is given secondary importance; the primary concern is towards participation. Whenever any help, or contribution is sought from anyone, firstly their participation is sought. It is only when a special need arises, that a monetary call for help is broadcasted</li>
